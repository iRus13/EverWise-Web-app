// Everwise - Scam Protection track
// Phase 16: Helping Others Stay Safe
//
// ⚠️ MISSING LESSONS — 9.1 and 9.2
// The source curriculum references two lessons that were never written:
//   9.1 "Help Without Embarrassing Someone"
//   9.2 "Be a Second Set of Eyes"  (checklist: sender, request, pressure, path, proof)
// Both are cited in the memory connections of 9.3, 9.4, and 9.5 and in the
// phase summary. The slots below (orders 1 and 2) are intentionally empty.
// When those lessons are written, insert them there — the references in the
// existing lessons already point at them.
