// Everwise - Scam Protection track
// Phase 12: Protecting Your Personal Information
//
// The phase is built around one question the learner carries throughout:
//   "Why do they need this information?"
//
// Passwords are taught with a single running metaphor — a key — so 5.2
// through 5.6 feel like one continuous idea rather than six separate topics.
